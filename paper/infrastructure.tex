\section{Censorship in IPv4 and IPv6}
\label{sec:infrastructure}

\para{Overview.} In this section, we focus on the difference in censorship
for DNS queries sent to the \textbf{IPv4 and IPv6 interfaes of resolvers}.
%
Specifically, we answer the following questions:
%
(\Cref{sec:infrastructure:country}) In which countries are the DNS censorship
mechanisms for IPv4 and IPv6 traffic significantly different?,
%
(\Cref{sec:infrastructure:resolvers}) what are the characteristics of resolvers
that exhibit differences in the censorship of IPv4 and IPv6 traffic?, and
%
(\Cref{sec:infrastructure:domains}) what are the characteristics of the domains
in which such differences are frequently exhibited?
