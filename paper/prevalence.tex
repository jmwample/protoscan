\section{Prevalence of Bidirectional Censorship}
\label{sec:prevalence}
\para{Overview.} In this section, we focus on \emph{providing a high-level
understanding on the prevalence of DNS censorship on IPv4 and IPv6 networks}.
Specifically, we measure the global prevalence of DNS censorship that occur in
the following four cases:
%
(1) a DNS {\tt A} query is sent over IPv4,
(2) a DNS {\tt AAAA} query is sent over IPv4,
(3) a DNS {\tt A} query is sent over IPv6, and
(4) a DNS {\tt AAAA} query is sent over IPv6.
%
While much of prior work has focused on case (1), the increased adoption of
IPv6 necessitates the analysis of cases (2-4) which are provided in our work.
%
In each case, we use our collected dataset (\cf \Cref{sec:methodology}) to
summarize the base rate of censorship.
