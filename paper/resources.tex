\section{Censorship of Resource Records} \label{sec:resources}

\para{Overview.}
In this section, we focus on {\it identifying and characterizing differences in
the handling of IPv4 and IPv6 resource records} in DNS censorship deployments.
Specifically, we seek to answer the following questions:
%
(\Cref{sec:resources:country}) In which countries is the censorship of IPv4
\textbf{resource records} (DNS {\tt A} queries) significantly different than the
censorship of IPv6 resource records (DNS {\tt AAAA} queries)?,
%
(\Cref{sec:resources:resolvers}) what are the characteristics of the
\textbf{resolvers} which exhibit differences in the handling of {\tt A} and {\tt
AAAA} queries?, and
%
(\Cref{sec:resources:domains}) what are the characteristics of \textbf{domains}
in which these differences are frequently observed?
